## General info
Build and program a prototype device for analyzing the frequency spectrum of the human pulse, using a Raspberry Pi (or other platform) single-chip minicomputer and microphones. Such analysis will be used to assess the physiological state of the human body, which has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine (and beyond).
	
## Technologies

### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi
* Microphones with low frequency response

### Software

* Linux based OS
* Python
 
## To do:

- construction of a prototype device using available parts and devices
- software of the device for data collection, analysis and visualization
- conducting preliminary tests on a group of volunteers: data collection, analysis, visualization
- attempt to find correlations between the obtained signals and diseases in given volunteers
- in case of finding such dependencies: building a predictive system, making diagnoses on the basis of measurements (using selected methods of machine learning)
- final determination of the effectiveness of the device
